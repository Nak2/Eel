# EEL - Easy Efficient Lua

EEL (Easy Efficient Lua) is an addon designed to make Garry's Mod addon development a breeze. With EEL, you can quickly run Lua commands, interact with entities, and automate repetitive tasks with ease. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started.

## Execution and Returns

Functions executed via `el_run` and other Lua commands will attempt to return not only the result but also the function definition along with its parameters. This aids in understanding how the function operates and assists in debugging.

If a command returns a vector (position), EEL will always visually display it. If it returns an entity, EEL will highlight it in the game, even if the entity is server-side only.

## Commands

### `el_run <code>` Command
The `el_run` command allows you to execute Lua code effortlessly. Itâ€™s semi-smart, meaning it will try to automatically resolve nil variables by mapping them to common references:

- `me` / `self` - The player who calls the function.
- `wep` - Your current weapon.
- `trace` - Eye-trace data.
- `this` / `that` - The entity you're looking at.
- `here` - Your current location.
- `there` - The location you're aiming at.
- `near` - The nearest entity to you.

If the command encounters an unknown variable, it will search in the following order:
1. Player names
2. Entity class names
3. Entity names
4. Entity models
5. Nearest matching entity

Example:
```
el_run nak:SetPos(there)
```

### `el_run_cl <code>` Command

This is the clientside equivalent of el_run, enabling you to run Lua code on the client.

### `el_sealed <code>` Command

The el_sealed command runs Lua code within a custom environment, giving you more control and isolation.

### `el_sealed_cl <code>` Command

Clientside version of el_sealed.

### `el_lazy <code>` Command

Feeling lazy? The el_lazy command automatically fills in parentheses for you. For example:
```

```

### `el_lazy_cl <code>` Command

Clientside version of el_lazy.

### `el_delete_all <entity class>` Command

This command deletes all entities of a given class on the map. It also tries to autofill nearby entities for convenience.

## Permission Management

EEL uses "CAMI" to integrate with admin-mods, giving you control over who can use these powerful commands. By default, these commands are only accessible by superadmins.
